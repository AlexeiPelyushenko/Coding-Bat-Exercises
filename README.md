# Coding-Bat-Exercises
Just some programming exercises from the website http://codingbat.com/java
I plan to go through all of these exercises. The exercises will both be
a way for me to practice programming, as well as an exercise in the usage of
GitHub as part of my workflow.

All the exercises(317 of them) have been completed as March 27th 2018.
