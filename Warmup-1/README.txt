-This folder will contain all of the exercises from the section "Warmup-1" on Coding Bat. Each exercise will have its own Java file.
-Though on the website, the code is written as a single method such as this: https://imgur.com/a/QH0Yk, 
-I will be writing my code for each exercise as a method in a class (on the odd chance that anyone wants to actually use the code)
-The naming of the file will tell which exercise number it is, as well as what the exercise is called, e.g. Ex01_SleepingIn.java
-Each exercise will have the details(verbatim from the site) written above it in a comment.
